# Game Explanation
Welcome to our game, **Duck Bread Defence**. This is our version of a tower defence style game, where the enemies are cats that want to attack you. You have to strategically place down the towers, which are ducks, that spit bread at the cats to kill them before they get to the end. We have incorporated an upgrade system for the ducks, which makes defeating the oncoming waves of enemies somewhat easier. We have a wave system too so enemies get more difficult to defeat and deal more damage as you play. To make the game a bit more entertaining and less boring to play, we also made a sound track that plays in the background of the game, as well as interaction noises.

## Aim of The Game
The aim of **Duck Bread Defence** is to eliminate the enemy cats before they reach the other side of the map. To do this you need to place down and upgrade ducks. While we have no official end goal for the game, you _are_ able to defend your bread indefinitely, and as such you can assume that the Aim of The Game is to last for as long as possible.

## Game Instructions
### Placing Ducks
To place ducks you need to first use your scroll wheel to select the type of duck you want, and then use the LMB (Left Mouse Button) to place it in the desired place.

### Upgrading Ducks
To update the ducks you have placed you just need to click on them, and a menu will open on the right side of the game. In the menu you can click the upgrade option and your duck will evolve.

# Technical Explanation
To build the game we used CMake to make transfering between other machines and general library linking as easy as we could. The language that we decided on is C++ due to its machine cross-compatability, and because general knowledge of C++ was high within the group. To render the windows and images we used the SDL2 c++ library, making use of the ttf and image modules, whilst using the SDL2 mixer module to be able to play sound. 

## Difficulties
Justinas - "I would say that the most difficult part of the project for me was getting it to actually build and run on my machine xD I must have switched between Linux and Windows 3 or 4 times before I got it to work the first time, and the worst thing is that it broke straight after I pulled again! We got there in the end though, which is what matters."
