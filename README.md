# Pre-Text
This game was made by **The Sleepy Squad**, consisting of Callum, Tilly, George, and Iris (Justinas).
We made this game for Nottingham Trent University 2nd Hack-a-Duck.

# Game Explanation
Welcome to our game, **Duck Bread Defence**. This is our version of a tower defence style game, where the enemies are cats that want to attack you. You have to strategically place down the towers, which are ducks, that spit bread at the cats to kill them before they get to the end.

# Aim of The Game
The aim of **Duck Bread Defence** is to eliminate the enemy cats before they reach the other side of the map. To do this you need to place down and upgrade ducks. While we have no official end goal for the game, you _are_ able to defend your bread indefinitely, and as such you can assume that the Aim of The Game is to last for as long as possible.

# Game Instructions
## Placing Ducks
To place ducks you need to first use your scroll wheel to select the type of duck you want, and then use the LMB (Left Mouse Button) to place it in the desired place.
